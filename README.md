# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The codvid-19 tracker app was build with reactjs and material-ui to fetch the covid daily updates from the API(https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) and also a feature that allows the user to select any country and get the update with regards to the selected country.
