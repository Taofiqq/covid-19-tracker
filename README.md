# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

As the fight against COVID-19 continues, monitoring the pandemicâ€™s progress has become a top priority. Awareness is essential in the wake of a crisis for citizens and data scientists alike. In this app, COVID-19 statistics (daily total confirmed, recovered and death cases) was fetched and outputted through an API. There is an option for the user to select their country of preference and follow up to date with the cases in their respective countries.
